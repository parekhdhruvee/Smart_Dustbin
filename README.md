<b>⋆ About:</b>

A Smart Dustbin is an innovative waste management solution that incorporates Arduino technology to enhance its functionality. Arduino is a microcontroller platform that allows for easy programming and integration of various sensors and actuators.

This Dustbin incorporates an ultrasonic sensor, a 9g servo motor, an Arduino board, and a battery to create an efficient waste management solution. The ultrasonic sensor detects the presence of waste or approaching objects, sending signals to the Arduino board. The Arduino processes these signals and controls the servo motor, which opens and closes the dustbin lid accordingly. With the battery powering the system, the Smart Dustbin operates independently of a direct power source. This integration of components enables the Smart Dustbin to automate lid control based on proximity, streamlining waste disposal.

Overall, a Smart Dustbin powered by Arduino technology offers an efficient and convenient waste management solution. It reduces the need for manual lid opening/closing, optimizes waste collection schedules, and promotes cleanliness and hygiene by keeping the dustbin covered at all times.
